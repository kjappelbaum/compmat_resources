Linear Algebra
--------------
* The `computational linear algebra for coders <https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra>` course is quite useful to get some practical linear algebra skills


Statistics
----------
* the course `inproving your statistical interference <https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences>`_ on coursera does a great job in clarifying p-values, bayesian vs. frequentist statistics and experimental design
