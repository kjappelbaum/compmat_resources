Linear Algebra
--------------

* The `computational linear algebra for coders <https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra>`_ course is quite useful to get some practical linear algebra skills. 
* The `no bullshit quite to linear algebra <https://minireference.com/>`_ is a easy and fun read. 

Statistics
----------

* the course `inproving your statistical interference <https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences>`_ on coursera does a great job in clarifying p-values, bayesian vs. frequentist statistics and experimental design
