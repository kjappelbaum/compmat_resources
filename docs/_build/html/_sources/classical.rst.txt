*  `T.J.H Vlugt <http://homepage.tudelft.nl/v9k6y/imsst/index.html>`_ has a nice book with basics of statistical
   thermodynamics, MD and MC
* `Scott Shell's lecture notes <https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/>`_ are really instructive
* The living journal of computational molecular science has nice texts on `MD basics <https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5957-best-practices-for-foundations-in-molecular-simulations-article-v1-0>`_
  (with really good references) and on `uncertainty <https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5067-best-practices-for-quantification-of-uncertainty-and-sampling-quality-in-molecular-simulations-article-v1-0>`_
* Slides and exercises from the `Molsim workshop <http://www.acmm.nl/molsim/molsim2019/>`_
* Common pitfalls discussed by Daan Frenkel in `Simulations: the dark side <https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4440>`_
