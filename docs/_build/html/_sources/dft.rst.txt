QM and DFT theoretical background
==================================

DFT
---

Online Resources
````````````````
* the `DFT book from John R. Kitchin <http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html>`_ does a good job in showing common workflows using `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__
* the `CompMatPhys MOOC <http://compmatphys.epotentia.com/courses/computational-materials-physics/>`_ also introduces
  basic workflows and concepts
* the `teaching the theory in density functional theory school <https://www.cecam.org/workshop-9-1326.html>`_ is a great way to review the theory of DFT (and already the first lecture discusses `Levy's constrained-search formulation <https://www.pnas.org/content/76/12/6062>`_ which is rarely mentioned in classcial curricula).

Articles
````````
* `Kieron Burke <http://dft.uci.edu/teaching.php>`_ is a great teach, his `ABC of DFT <http://dft.uci.edu/teaching/lausanne/ABCDFT.pdf>`_ is particulary useful. 


QM (general)
-------------

Online Resources
`````````````````
* the course by `Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik <https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-world-harvardx-chem160x>`_ is really good and
  also covers concepts like the Wigner function that are usually not taught in introductory-level courses.


Time dependent QM 
-----------------

Books
`````
* The classic book in this field is probably the one written by Tannor: `Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - 
  A Time-Dependent Perspective <http://www.weizmann.ac.il/chemphys/tannor/Book/>`_
