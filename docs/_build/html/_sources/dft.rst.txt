QM and DFT theoretical background
==================================

DFT
---

Online Resources
````````````````
* the `DFT book from John R. Kitchin <http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html>`_ does a good job in showing common workflows using `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__
* the `CompMatPhys MOOC <http://compmatphys.epotentia.com/courses/computational-materials-physics/>`_ also introduces
  basic workflows and concepts
* the `teaching the theory in density functional theory school <https://www.cecam.org/workshop-9-1326.html>`_ is a great way to review the theory of DFT (and already the first lecture discusses `Levy's constrained-search formulation <https://www.pnas.org/content/76/12/6062>`_ which is rarely mentioned in classcial curricula).

Articles
````````
* `Kieron Burke <http://dft.uci.edu/teaching.php>`_ is a great teacher, his `ABC of DFT <http://dft.uci.edu/teaching/lausanne/ABCDFT.pdf>`_ is particulary useful. 


QM (general)
-------------

Online Resources
`````````````````
* the course by `Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik <https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-world-harvardx-chem160x>`_ is really good and
  also covers concepts like the Wigner function that are usually not taught in introductory-level courses.


Time dependent QM 
-----------------

Books
`````
* The classic book in this field is probably the one written by Tannor: `Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - 
  A Time-Dependent Perspective <http://www.weizmann.ac.il/chemphys/tannor/Book/>`_ 
* A bit more applied is Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry by Schatz and Ratner.
* Peter Hamm wrote a practical summary of `Mukamel's book about nonlinear spectroscopy <https://mukamel.ps.uci.edu/books.html>`_, which includes good information about the density picture and Feynman diagrams. It's called `Mukamel for dummies <http://www.mitr.p.lodz.pl/evu/lectures/Hamm.pdf>`_ 

Interesting papers
``````````````````
* `Eric Heller <https://www-heller.harvard.edu/>`_ has done some great work on the wavepacket picture (which is in my opinion on of the most intutive ways to understand spectra), his papers are usually quite well written:

  * `Guided Gaussian Wave Packets <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ar040196y>`_ gives a nice overview of the anatomy of Gaussian wavepacket and methods beyond the TGA
  * The orginal paper `Time-dependent approach to semiclassical dynamics  <https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.430620?class=pdf>`_ is also worth reading. 
  * A really nice connection to spectra (e.g. timescales in autocorrelation function and spectrum) is given in `The Semiclassical Way to Molecular Spectroscopy <https://homepage.univie.ac.at/mario.barbatti/papers/heller/heller_acs_14_368_1981.pdf>`_
