* the `DFT book from John R. Kitchin <http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html>`_ does a good job in showing common workflows using `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__

* The classic book in this field is probably the one written by Tannor: `Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - 
  A Time-Dependent Perspective <http://www.weizmann.ac.il/chemphys/tannor/Book/>`_
