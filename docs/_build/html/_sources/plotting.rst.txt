Pandas
-------
Recently, I found that pandas has a lot of nice plotting tools builtin which I do not use often enough:
* The autocorrelation plot is nice to analyze time series (e.g. simulation trajectories)
* Andrews curves are a good waz to analyze multidimensional datasets
* The bootstrap plot gives you information about the uncertainty of the statistics you get from pandas
