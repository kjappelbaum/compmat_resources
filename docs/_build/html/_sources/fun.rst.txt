* Interesting pieces in the chemical literature `collected by Prof. Hintermann <http://www.oca.ch.tum.de/index.php?id=2902>`_
* `Chocolate Consumption, Cognitive Function, and Nobel Laureates <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMon1211064>`_
* `Growth of Diamond Films from Tequila <https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1485v1>`_ 
* `Learnability is unprovable.  <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00083-3>`_ Similar to the logical paradoxes Gödel discovered and the continuum hypothesis there might be a universe in wish something is learnable from a finite sample whereas there also might be one where this is not possible 
* `Two layers are enough to memorise random labels <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf>`_ (especially the influence of regularization is interesting). A wider context is in this nice blogpost: https://www.inference.vc/everything-that-works-works-because-its-bayesian-2/
* :code:`import this` 
* `statistical thermodynamics as the maximally noncommital choice (link to information theory via maximum-entropy distributions and Shannon entropy) <http://www.sns.ias.edu/~tlusty/courses/InfoInBio/Papers/JaynesInformationTheory.pdf>`_ 
* I do not like describing entropy as disorder as I think that it can be misleading:
  * `Disorder - A Cracked Crutch for Supporting Entropy Discussions <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed079p187>`_
  * `Entropy producing complex, ordered structures <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08641>`_  (cp. Onsager rods or freezing hard spheres, also interesting is the influence of the entropy tax on self-assembly)
  * `Order through entropy <https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4178?page=4>`_
* Living in Switzerland, `this <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.8b02424>`_ is essential knowledge 
* Pickard's `hyperspatial geometry optimization <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02232v1>`_ seems quite interesting for me to expedite geometry searches and it reminded me of the Nosé-Hoover thermostat ... 
* `Our AI skills might be worth less than we think <https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/01/your-ai-skills-worth-less-than-you-think.html>`_
