* `shap <https://github.com/slundberg/shap>`_ : Shapely values are a nice way 
  to bring interpretability to Machine Learning. The 
  `intepretable machine learning book <https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html>`_
  gives an overview over this and other methods for interpretable ML 
* holoviews 
* `pandas profiling <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling>`_ gives some more useful information
  for exploratory data analysis than :code:`df.describe()` 
* `feature selector <https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/feature-selector>`_
  is a useful package for intial steps of feature engineering 
* If you already have (ASE) trajectories around, then `AMP <https://amp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ can be nice
  to build a ML model based on them
* `QML <http://www.qmlcode.org/>`_ has a similar goal. It has efficient implementations to calculate representations
  and kernels
* `matminer <https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer>`_ is really useful to compute common descriptors
* `Edward <http://edwardlib.org/>`_ is a nice package for probabilistic modelling like bayesian neural nets.
* `PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io/>`_ is a popular package for probabilistic programming
