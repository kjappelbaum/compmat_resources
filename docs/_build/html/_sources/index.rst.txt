Welcome to Computational Materials Science Resources
=====================================================================

This document is a summary of resources that help(ed) me getting started in the
field of computational materials science. 

I guess that it will need some time until I find a good organization but the 
main intent for writing this is having a place where I can keep track of useful stuff.
